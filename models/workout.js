//* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

//tracking:

//name
//type of exercise(cardio or resistance)
//weight achieved
//number of sets
//number of reps
//duration of exercise
//distance for cardio
